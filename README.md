# Welcome to RPG-LOGIC GAME

This a rpg game where there is only its logic. The idea is not 100% defined atm. Actually, I just started to think about it. What I see for the final game is a webpage where we can either write commands inside an input OR I'll just make a bunch of buttons for atk/skill, etc.
And ofc, this game will follow classic rpg logics.
